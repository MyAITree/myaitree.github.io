Robert Nozick, a prominent libertarian philosopher, presents a compelling argument against taxation in his influential work *Anarchy, State, and Utopia* (1974). His critique is rooted in his theory of justice and individual rights, particularly his entitlement theory of justice and his view of the minimal state.

### **Nozick’s Argument Against Taxation**
Nozick’s core argument is that **taxation is a form of forced labor** and thus violates individuals' rights to self-ownership and property. Here’s a breakdown of his reasoning:

1. **Self-Ownership and Property Rights**  
   - Nozick begins with the premise that individuals own themselves—their bodies, labor, and talents.  
   - If you own yourself, you also own the fruits of your labor (what you produce or earn).  
   - Forced taxation, in this view, is equivalent to taking a portion of someone’s labor without their consent, which Nozick compares to slavery or forced labor.

2. **The Entitlement Theory of Justice**  
   - Nozick’s theory of justice is based on three principles:  
     - **Justice in acquisition** (how property is originally obtained).  
     - **Justice in transfer** (how property is voluntarily exchanged).  
     - **Rectification of injustice** (correcting past unjust acquisitions or transfers).  
   - If property is acquired justly (without coercion or fraud), then any redistribution by the state (through taxation) is unjust because it violates voluntary exchanges.

3. **Taxation as Redistribution is Unjust**  
   - Nozick famously critiques redistributive taxation (e.g., welfare, social programs) by comparing it to **"taking the earnings of some to give to others."**  
   - He uses the **Wilt Chamberlain example**: If people freely choose to pay to watch Chamberlain play basketball, and the government taxes his earnings to redistribute wealth, this violates the voluntary choices of both Chamberlain and his fans.  
   - This undermines **liberty**—people should be free to dispose of their resources as they choose.

4. **The Minimal State**  
   - Nozick argues that the only justifiable state is a **"night-watchman state"**—one that enforces contracts, protects against force and fraud, and secures basic rights.  
   - Any state that goes beyond this (e.g., through welfare programs, public education, or wealth redistribution) is unjust because it requires coercive taxation.  

### **Implications of Nozick’s Argument**
- **Against Rawls’ Difference Principle**: Nozick directly opposes John Rawls’ theory of distributive justice, which permits redistribution to benefit the least advantaged. Nozick argues that justice is about **process** (how holdings are acquired) rather than **pattern** (how wealth is distributed).  
- **Voluntary Charity Over Forced Redistribution**: Nozick suggests that if people want to help the poor, they should do so voluntarily, not through state coercion.  
- **Taxation as Theft?** Some libertarians extend Nozick’s argument to claim that taxation is **theft**, since it takes property without consent.  

### **Criticisms of Nozick’s View**
1. **Overemphasis on Self-Ownership**: Critics argue that absolute self-ownership ignores social cooperation and the role of society in enabling individual success.  
2. **Ignores Structural Inequality**: Nozick’s theory doesn’t account for systemic injustices (e.g., inherited wealth disparities, historical oppression) that may require redistribution.  
3. **Practicality of the Minimal State**: Some argue that a minimal state would fail to provide essential public goods (e.g., infrastructure, education, healthcare).  

### **Conclusion**
Nozick’s argument against taxation is a foundational libertarian critique of state power, emphasizing **individual rights, voluntary exchange, and the injustice of forced redistribution**. While influential, it remains controversial, especially in debates over economic justice and the role of government.
