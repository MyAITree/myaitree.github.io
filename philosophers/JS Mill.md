To create a visually symbolic painting of **John Stuart Mill**'s philosophy, we'll center the composition around his core ideas: **liberty**, **utilitarianism**, **individuality**, and **progressive social reform**. Mill’s work bridges Enlightenment rationalism and 19th-century liberalism, making him both a defender of individual freedom and a moral philosopher who sought the greatest happiness.
